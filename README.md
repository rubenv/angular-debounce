# angular-debounce

> Tiny debouncing function for Angular.JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/angular-debounce.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/angular-debounce)

Debouncing is a form of rate-limiting: it prevents rapid-firing of events. You
can use this to throttle calls to an autocomplete API: call a function multiple
times and it won't get called more than once during the time interval you
specify.

## Usage
Add angular-debounce to your project:

```
bower install --save angular-debounce
```

or

```
npm install --save angular-debounce
```

Add it to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="bower_components/angular-debounce/dist/angular-debounce.min.js"></script>
```

Reference it as a dependency for your app module:

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['rt.debounce']);
```

Or When your using Webpack, skip the script tag and

```js
import rtDebounce from 'angular-debounce'

angular.module('myApp', [rtDebounce]);
```

Use it:

```js
angular.module('myApp').controller('testCtrl', function (debounce) {
    // Inject through "debounce".

    // Creates a function that will only get called once every 2 seconds:
    var fn = debounce(2000, function () {
        // Do things here.
    });

    // Call it a couple of times, will only invoke the wrapped function
    // 2 seconds after the last invocation:
    fn();
    fn();
    fn();

    // Want to stop waiting and send out the call immediately? Flush it!
    fn.flush();

    // Want to stop waiting and send out the call immediately if any was made?
    // Flush pending calls!
    fn.flushPending();

    // No longer care about it? Cancel is supported.
    fn.cancel();
});
```

Repeatedly calling `fn()` will postpone indefinitely. Pass a third `true` parameter to also fire intermediate calls:

```js
var fn = debounce(2000, function () {
    // Do things here.
}, true);
```
